# Retail Store Sales' drivers

(1) Pick the variables:-
          Knowing your problem and
          understanding what drives it is
          key for a business analyst. Choose
          the variables that make business
          sense.
          
          
(2) Analyze the data:-
          Performing the summary statistics
          command enables to get to know
          better the variables through statistics
          like the mean, median, and standard
          deviation.
          

(3) Correlation Matrix:-
          The Correlation Matrix allows you
          to pick variables for your model.
          Remember that if the correlation is
          close to 1 or -1, you may have a
          multicollinearity issue.
          
          
(4) Training and Test Set:-
          Create a training and test set with an
          80/20 split. This allows an unbiased
          assessment of the model.
          
          
(5) Multilinear Regression:-
          This is game time. You are now
          ready to create a multilinear
          regression. Don't forget to add the
          constant to the X group :).


(6) Accuracy Assessment:-
          Look at the key metrics to
          understand whether your model is
          good at predicting sales drivers.
          That will give you more trust in the
          insights.
